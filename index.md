# NLP+CSS 201: Beyond the basics 

This website hosts the upcoming tutorial series for advanced NLP methods, for computational social science scholars.

Every few weeks, we will host some experts in the field of computational social science to present a new method in NLP, and to lead participants in an interactive exploration of the method with code and sample text data.
If you are a graduate student or researcher who has some introductory knowledge of NLP (e.g. has learned text analysis from [SICSS](https://sicss.io/curriculum)) and wants to "level up", come join us!

Watch past tutorials on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcFcF9DkanjaK3HEk7bsd-A).

## Tutorial format

- **Introduction**: the facilitators introduce their method and the code/data associated with the method.
- **Interaction**: the participants break out into small groups to test out the method using the provided code. The code includes several spots for experimenting with the method, which can help the participants better understand the benefits and limitations of the method. The participants may also bring their own data for analysis if desired.
- **Conclusion**: the facilitators bring all participants together to collect their experiences with the method and to share final thoughts on possible improvements on the method.

Tutorials will last one hour and we encourage participants to join live. However, we will also make the recordings and code publicly available afterwards.


## Logistics on joining tutorials live   

We will send out the tutorial video link to our mailing list a few days before the tutorial starts.
